# Task Plan: State-of-the-art Deep Agent Research and Top 10 GitHub Projects

## Goal
Provide a concise state-of-the-art overview of deep agent research and identify the top 10 open-source GitHub projects with implementations as of now, including brief descriptions, key features, and links.

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Plan and setup
- [ ] Phase 2: Research/gather information
- [ ] Phase 3: Compile top projects and craft deliverable
- [ ] Phase 4: Review and deliver

## Key Questions
1. What exactly qualifies as a "deep agent" in this context (LLM-based agents, reinforcement learning agents, or general autonomous agents using deep models and tools)?
2. What criteria define the 'top' GitHub projects (stars, activity, citations, documentation, usability)?
3. Should we include multi-modal or robotics-oriented agents?
