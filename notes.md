# Notes: State-of-the-art Deep Agent Research

## Scope
- Define what constitutes a "deep agent" (agents that autonomously perform tasks using deep models, capable of planning, action selection, and tool use).
- Cover both LLM-based agents with tooling and traditional deep RL/agent architectures.

## Key Topics
- LLM-based autonomous agents and tool use
- Agent frameworks and orchestration (planning, execution, and memory)
- Multi-agent coordination and collaboration
- Embodied/deep reinforcement learning for autonomy
- Execution environments and benchmarks for agents

## Potential Sources (to be filled)
- Papers, blogs, and repositories that describe state-of-the-art agent architectures and implementations

## Synthesized Findings (to be filled)
- Emerging design patterns
- Common components: planner, action executor, memory, tool-using interfaces
- Evaluation criteria for agents
