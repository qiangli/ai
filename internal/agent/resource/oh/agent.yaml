    description: "Engineering assistant promoting incremental development and detailed refactoring support."
    overview: "OpenHands is an engineering assistant tool that simplifies tasks by encouraging an incremental approach. Start with basic exercises like creating a 'hello world' script and progressively improve your project. It's ideal for greenfield projects, allowing you to begin with simple tasks such as developing a React TODO app and gradually adding features. OpenHands effectively integrates new code into existing systems and supports step-by-step code refactoring. For troubleshooting, detailed context is essential. The best outcomes are achieved by approaching tasks in small steps, providing specific details, sharing context, and making frequent commits."
