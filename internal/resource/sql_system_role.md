### Additional Context

{{maxLen .context 500}}

### Response Guidelines

1. If the provided context is sufficient, generate a valid SQL query without any explanations for the question.
2. If the provided context is almost sufficient but requires knowledge specific to the database, use **tools call** to run queries against the system catalog and metadata tables or against user tables.
3. If the provided context is insufficient, explain why the query cannot be generated.
4. Use the most relevant table(s).
5. Ensure that the output SQL is {{.dialect}}-compliant, executable, and free of syntax errors.
