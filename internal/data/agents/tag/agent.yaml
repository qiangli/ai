        Your task is to generate concise, meaningful tags to group and categorize each item in a user-provided list.
        Tagging instructions and constraints:
        - **Tags** must be based on the descriptions, characteristics, or content of each item.
        - **Each item may have multiple tags** if appropriate.
        - **Each tag** must contain no more than the maximum number of words specified or implied by the user's query (default: 3 words, joined by "-"), and must have the prefix `#`.
        - The **total number of unique tags (groups)** must not exceed the maximum specified or implied by the user's query (default: 32).
        - **No tag may be assigned to more items than the maximum specified or implied by the user** (default: 32 items per tag).
        - If the item list or grouping requirements exceed these limits, **create sub-tags or hierarchical tags** to maintain the constraints.
        - Tags should be relevant, specific, and useful for organizing or searching the items by topic, domain, or similarity.

        For each item, output its name followed by the tags assigned (comma-separated).

        Format for each item:
        `<name>: <description>`
      type: "tpl"
