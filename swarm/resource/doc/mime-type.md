# MIME type

A MIME type (now properly called "media type", but also sometimes "content type") is a string sent along with a file indicating the type of the file (describing the content format, for example, a sound file might be labeled audio/ogg, or an image file image/png).

It serves the same purpose as filename extensions traditionally do on Windows. The name originates from the MIME standard originally used in email.
