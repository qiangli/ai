      Implements Manus-style persistent, markdown-based planning and workflow tracking.
      Follows the 'Planning with Files' pattern to structure, update, and reason about complex multi-phase tasks.
      Reads plan before each major decision, updates phase/progress files, persists errors, and guarantees durable, transparent execution trails.
      Leverages context and error handling principles.

      # Planning with Files

      Work like Manus: Use persistent markdown files as your "working memory on disk."

      ## FIRST: Check for Previous Session

      **Before starting work**, check for unsynced context from a previous session:

      ```bash
      # Linux/macOS
      $(command -v python3 || command -v python) ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/session-catchup.py "$(pwd)"
      ```

      ```powershell
      # Windows PowerShell
      & (Get-Command python -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).Source "$env:USERPROFILE\.claude\skills\planning-with-files\scripts\session-catchup.py" (Get-Location)
      ```

      If catchup report shows unsynced context:
      1. Run `git diff --stat` to see actual code changes
      2. Read current planning files
      3. Update planning files based on catchup + git diff
      4. Then proceed with task

      ## Important: Where Files Go

      - **Templates** are in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/`
      - **Your planning files** go in **your project directory**

      | Location | What Goes There |
      |----------|-----------------|
      | Skill directory (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/`) | Templates, scripts, reference docs |
      | Your project directory | `task_plan.md`, `findings.md`, `progress.md` |

      ## Quick Start

      Before ANY complex task:

      1. **Create `task_plan.md`** — Use [templates/task_plan.md](templates/task_plan.md) as reference
      2. **Create `findings.md`** — Use [templates/findings.md](templates/findings.md) as reference
      3. **Create `progress.md`** — Use [templates/progress.md](templates/progress.md) as reference
      4. **Re-read plan before decisions** — Refreshes goals in attention window
      5. **Update after each phase** — Mark complete, log errors

      > **Note:** Planning files go in your project root, not the skill installation folder.

      ## The Core Pattern

      ```
      Context Window = RAM (volatile, limited)
      Filesystem = Disk (persistent, unlimited)

      → Anything important gets written to disk.
      ```

      ## File Purposes

      | File | Purpose | When to Update |
      |------|---------|----------------|
      | `task_plan.md` | Phases, progress, decisions | After each phase |
      | `findings.md` | Research, discoveries | After ANY discovery |
      | `progress.md` | Session log, test results | Throughout session |

      ## Critical Rules

      ### 1. Create Plan First
      Never start a complex task without `task_plan.md`. Non-negotiable.

      ### 2. The 2-Action Rule
      > "After every 2 view/browser/search operations, IMMEDIATELY save key findings to text files."

      This prevents visual/multimodal information from being lost.

      ### 3. Read Before Decide
      Before major decisions, read the plan file. This keeps goals in your attention window.

      ### 4. Update After Act
      After completing any phase:
      - Mark phase status: `in_progress` → `complete`
      - Log any errors encountered
      - Note files created/modified

      ### 5. Log ALL Errors
      Every error goes in the plan file. This builds knowledge and prevents repetition.

      ```markdown
      ## Errors Encountered
      | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
      |-------|---------|------------|
      | FileNotFoundError | 1 | Created default config |
      | API timeout | 2 | Added retry logic |
      ```

      ### 6. Never Repeat Failures
      ```
      if action_failed:
          next_action != same_action
      ```
      Track what you tried. Mutate the approach.

      ## The 3-Strike Error Protocol

      ```
      ATTEMPT 1: Diagnose & Fix
        → Read error carefully
        → Identify root cause
        → Apply targeted fix

      ATTEMPT 2: Alternative Approach
        → Same error? Try different method
        → Different tool? Different library?
        → NEVER repeat exact same failing action

      ATTEMPT 3: Broader Rethink
        → Question assumptions
        → Search for solutions
        → Consider updating the plan

      AFTER 3 FAILURES: Escalate to User
        → Explain what you tried
        → Share the specific error
        → Ask for guidance
      ```

      ## Read vs Write Decision Matrix

      | Situation | Action | Reason |
      |-----------|--------|--------|
      | Just wrote a file | DON'T read | Content still in context |
      | Viewed image/PDF | Write findings NOW | Multimodal → text before lost |
      | Browser returned data | Write to file | Screenshots don't persist |
      | Starting new phase | Read plan/findings | Re-orient if context stale |
      | Error occurred | Read relevant file | Need current state to fix |
      | Resuming after gap | Read all planning files | Recover state |

      ## The 5-Question Reboot Test

      If you can answer these, your context management is solid:

      | Question | Answer Source |
      |----------|---------------|
      | Where am I? | Current phase in task_plan.md |
      | Where am I going? | Remaining phases |
      | What's the goal? | Goal statement in plan |
      | What have I learned? | findings.md |
      | What have I done? | progress.md |

      ## When to Use This Pattern

      **Use for:**
      - Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
      - Research tasks
      - Building/creating projects
      - Tasks spanning many tool calls
      - Anything requiring organization

      **Skip for:**
      - Simple questions
      - Single-file edits
      - Quick lookups

      ## Templates

      Copy these templates to start:

      - [templates/task_plan.md](templates/task_plan.md) — Phase tracking
      - [templates/findings.md](templates/findings.md) — Research storage
      - [templates/progress.md](templates/progress.md) — Session logging

      ## Scripts

      Helper scripts for automation:

      - `scripts/init-session.sh` — Initialize all planning files
      - `scripts/check-complete.sh` — Verify all phases complete
      - `scripts/session-catchup.py` — Recover context from previous session (v2.2.0)

      ## Advanced Topics

      - **Manus Principles:** See [reference.md](reference.md)
      - **Real Examples:** See [examples.md](examples.md)

      ## Anti-Patterns

      | Don't | Do Instead |
      |-------|------------|
      | Use TodoWrite for persistence | Create task_plan.md file |
      | State goals once and forget | Re-read plan before decisions |
      | Hide errors and retry silently | Log errors to plan file |
      | Stuff everything in context | Store large content in files |
      | Start executing immediately | Create plan file FIRST |
      | Repeat failed actions | Track attempts, mutate approach |
      | Create files in skill directory | Create files in your project |
