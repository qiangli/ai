    description: |
      Compute a unified diff between two files using a pure-Go implementation.
      The tool returns the unified diff text when files differ and returns a
      non-zero exit (error) in that case so callers can use shell-style `||`
      to react to differences, matching the behavior of the unix `diff` utility.
