models:
  L1:
    model: "grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning"
    description: |
      Cost: low. Fastest / highest throughput (non-reasoning).
      Best for: simple chat, short summaries, rewriting, classification/extraction, routing,
      and other high-volume agent steps where latency and cost matter.
      Tradeoffs: weaker on deep multi-step reasoning; may miss subtle constraints.

  L2:
    model: "grok-4-1-fast-reasoning"
    description: |
      Cost: low–mid. Fast with explicit reasoning.
      Best for: planning, multi-step analysis, harder instructions, and tool-using agents when L1 is
      inconsistent but you still want good latency.
      Tradeoffs: not the highest-end quality; use L3 for hardest problems.

  L3:
    model: "grok-4"
    description: |
      Cost: mid–high. Flagship quality.
      Best for: complex reasoning, high-stakes answers, difficult debugging/design, and long-form
      synthesis where correctness matters more than cost.

  latest:
    model: "grok-4-latest"
    description: |
      Cost: mid–high. Moving alias to the newest Grok 4 generation.
      Best for: production routing when you want automatic upgrades to the latest features.
      Tradeoffs: may change behavior over time; pin to a specific version if stability is required.

  vision:
    model: "grok-4-vision"
    description: |
      Cost: mid–high (plus image token costs). Multimodal (text+image) understanding.
      Best for: interpreting screenshots, charts, UI issues, documents, and image-grounded Q&A.
      Notes: image/video tools are billed by image tokens; tool invocation itself may be $0, but token
      usage still applies (per docs).

  image:
    model: "grok-2-image"
    description: |
      Cost: mid. Image generation.
      Best for: creating images from prompts or iterating on visual concepts.
      Notes: use when the user explicitly requests image output.

# pricing_notes:
#   token_costs: |
#     Token costs vary by model and by token type.
#     Verify current rates on: https://docs.x.ai/docs/models
#   tool_costs: |
#     Server-side tools may add per-invocation charges on top of token costs.
#     Examples from docs:
#     - Live Search: $25 per 1,000 sources requested (each source used counts).
#     - Usage guidelines violation fee: $0.05 per violating request (rare).
