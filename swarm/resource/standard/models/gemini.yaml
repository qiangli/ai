models:
  L1:
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"
    description: |
      Ultra-fast Flash-Lite tier optimized for cost-efficiency and high throughput.
      Best for: simple chat, tagging/classification, extraction, bulk summarization, routing.
      Supports: long context (~1M), multimodal input (text/image/video/audio/PDF), function calling,
      structured outputs, caching, batch API, code execution, file search, search grounding,
      URL context; some variants support Google Maps grounding.
      Tradeoffs: less capable on deep reasoning vs Pro.
      Cost: lowest (verify on pricing page).

  L2:
    model: "gemini-2.5-flash"
    description: |
      Best price–performance workhorse for low-latency, large-scale tasks that still require “thinking”.
      Best for: agentic tool use at scale, multimodal understanding, and reliable structured outputs.
      Supports: long context (~1M), multimodal input (text/image/video/audio), function calling,
      structured outputs, caching, batch API, code execution, file search, search grounding,
      URL context; some variants add Live API / TTS / Google Maps grounding.
      Cost: mid (verify on pricing page).

  L3:
    model: "gemini-2.5-pro"
    description: |
      Advanced thinking model for hardest tasks: complex reasoning in code/math/STEM,
      long-context synthesis, analyzing large datasets/codebases/documents.
      Supports: long context (~1M), multimodal input (text/image/video/audio/PDF), thinking,
      function calling, structured outputs, caching, batch API, code execution, file search,
      search grounding, URL context; some variants add TTS.
      Cost: highest (verify on pricing page).
