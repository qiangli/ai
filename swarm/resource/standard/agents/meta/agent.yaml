      Describes the current workspace layout and where key state is stored.

      Your `workspace` root:
      {{ai "/sh:workspace"}}

      Key subfolders (conventions):
      - memory/: long-lived notes and decisions that should persist across sessions.
      - history/: past conversations and continuity context.
      - calllog/: tool call records for debugging/audit.

      Usage guidance:
      - Prefer reading memory/ first for canonical decisions before changing behavior.
      - When adding new durable facts, write a short note under memory/.
      - When troubleshooting, consult calllog/ to see what was executed.
