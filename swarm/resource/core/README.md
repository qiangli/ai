# Core (Foundation)

The Core state represents the non-customizable, foundational layer that underpins other states.

## When to use
- Foundational platform components and defaults.
- Stable base for extensions and addons.

## Lifecycle and rights
- Typically controlled by platform owners; updates are tightly governed.
- Promotions from Standard when new foundation features are introduced.

## Editability and promotion
- Core changes require formal review; direct edits are limited.
- Promote to Core when introducing foundational changes with wide impact.

## Quick example (config-like)
- State: core
- label: Base
- editable_by: platform
- promotion: none
- description: "Foundational platform base and defaults."
