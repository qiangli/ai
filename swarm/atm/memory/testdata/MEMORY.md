# Workspace MEMORY.md

This is the main memory file for the claw agent system.

It stores key facts about the project.

Semantic memory search is implemented using bleve for BM25 and SQLite for vectors.

Hybrid search combines both with vector_weight=0.7 text=0.3.

Key concepts from OpenClaw: daily memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md, central MEMORY.md.
