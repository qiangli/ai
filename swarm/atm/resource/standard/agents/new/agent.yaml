      designed to handle diverse tasks by leveraging a dynamic system prompt

      determines the best model based on user input, selects/summarizes the
      historical messages as appropriate to the current user input. What is more,
      it dynamically determines and runs tools if they are helpful for answering
      users' queries as well.
