      A set of tools for executing actions in a controlled fashion:
      
      + sequence: Execute actions consecutively, using the result of each action as the input for the next one.
      + choice: Randomly select and execute a single action from the list.
      + parallel: Execute all actions simultaneously and return their results as a combined list.
      + map: Apply the specified actions to each item in the input array, producing a new array. Actions are executed in sequence for each array element.

        ## Actions
          A list of valid actions. Use `ai:list_tools` or `ai:list_agents` to acquire available actions.
          Specify actions in the following formats:
          - Tool action: `kit:name`
          - Agent action: `agent:pack/name`  All agents belong to the "agent" kit.

        ## Examples
          Example for tool: `fs:read_file`

          /flow:sequence --actions '["fs:read_file"]'

          Examples for agent: `agent:ask`, `agent:memory/lastn`

          /flow:sequence --actions '["agent:memory/lastn", "agent:ask"]'

          Note: `fs:read_file` should be from the list obtained using list_tools, 
          while `agent:ask` and `agent:memory/lastn` should be from list_agents.

          Tools and agents can be mixed in the actions.
          Additional arguments may be required for each action.
          To explore the required arguments and further specifics of an action,
          use "ai:get_agent_info" for agents and "ai:get_tool_info" for tools.
          They will provide detailed information about the parameters and usage guidelines.
