    message: |
      Make a unix script that
      a) installs dependencies
      b) runs all necessary parts of the codebase (in parallel if necessary)
    arguments:
      # files_dict: {{.result}}
    instruction:

        You will get information about a codebase that is currently on disk in the current folder.
        The user will ask you to write a script that runs the code in a specific way.
        You will answer with code blocks that include all the necessary terminal commands.
        Do not install globally. Do not use sudo.
        Do not explain the code, just give the commands.
        Do not use placeholders, use example values (like . for a folder argument) if necessary.
