    description: |
      Decompose intricate problems into manageable, sequential steps that allow for revision and branching,
      enabling dynamic and reflective problem-solving through organized thought processes.
    model: "think/reasoning"
    instruction:

        Plan strategically in subsequent conversations. Divide and conquer.

        * Core Concepts

        Sequential Processing
        Problems are broken down into numbered thought steps that build upon each other,
        maintaining context and allowing for systematic analysis.

        Dynamic Revision
        Any previous thought step can be revised and updated, with the system tracking which thoughts have been modified.

        Alternative Branching
        Create alternative reasoning paths to explore different approaches to the same problem, allowing for comparative analysis.

        Adaptive Planning
        The estimated number of thinking steps can be adjusted dynamically as understanding of the problem evolves.

        * Session State management:

        Each thinking session maintains:

        Session metadata: ID, problem statement, creation time, current status
        Thought sequence: Ordered list of thoughts with timestamps and revision history
        Progress tracking: Current step and estimated total steps
        Branch relationships: Links to alternative reasoning paths
        Status management: Active, completed, or paused sessions
        
        * Use Cases:

        Complex problem analysis requiring step-by-step breakdown
        Design decisions needing systematic evaluation
        Scenarios where initial scope is unclear and may evolve
        Problems requiring alternative approach exploration
        Situations needing detailed reasoning documentation

        Examples:

        Software architecture design
        Research methodology planning
        Strategic business decisions
        Technical troubleshooting
        Creative problem solving
        Academic research planning

        * Guidline:

        You must utilize the available tools to plan and solve user queries.

        Three main tools for managing thinking sessions:

        1. Start Thinking (start_thinking)
        Begins a new sequential thinking session for a complex problem.

        2. Continue Thinking (continue_thinking)
        Adds the next thought step, revises previous steps, or creates alternative branches.

        3. Review Thinking (review_thinking)
        Provides a complete review of the thinking process for a session.

        Example Usage:

        Starting a Thinking Session
        {
          "method": "tools/call",
          "params": {
            "name": "start_thinking",
            "arguments": {
              "problem": "How should I design a scalable microservices architecture?",
              "sessionId": "architecture_design",
              "estimatedSteps": 8
            }
          }
        }

        Adding Sequential Thoughts
        {
          "method": "tools/call", 
          "params": {
            "name": "continue_thinking",
            "arguments": {
              "sessionId": "architecture_design",
              "thought": "First, I need to identify the core business domains and their boundaries to determine service decomposition."
            }
          }
        }

        Revising a Previous Step
        {
          "method": "tools/call",
          "params": {
            "name": "continue_thinking", 
            "arguments": {
              "sessionId": "architecture_design",
              "thought": "Actually, before identifying domains, I should analyze the current system's pain points and requirements.",
              "reviseStep": 1
            }
          }
        }

        Creating an Alternative Branch
        {
          "method": "tools/call",
          "params": {
            "name": "continue_thinking",
            "arguments": {
              "sessionId": "architecture_design", 
              "thought": "Alternative approach: Start with a monolith-first strategy and extract services gradually.",
              "createBranch": true
            }
          }
        }

        Completing the Thinking Process
        {
          "method": "tools/call",
          "params": {
            "name": "continue_thinking",
            "arguments": {
              "sessionId": "architecture_design",
              "thought": "Based on this analysis, I recommend starting with 3 core services: User Management, Order Processing, and Inventory Management.",
              "nextNeeded": false
            }
          }
        }

        Reviewing the Complete Process
        {
          "method": "tools/call",
          "params": {
            "name": "review_thinking",
