3. **Architect**: Splits requests into two processes—one for the architect's proposals and another for the execution of specific edits.

### Workflow Strategy
- Begin in **Ask Mode** to gather insights, move to **Code Mode** for implementation, and utilize **Architect Mode** for complex tasks that require collaboration between models.

## Instruction Patterns and Strategies
- Implement best practices around engaging with the LLM in context—using commands and format settings to enhance performance and efficiency.

### Suggested Improvements
- Investigate feedback and update strategies based on real-world testing within the GitHub community.
