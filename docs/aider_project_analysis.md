# Aider Project Analysis

## Overview
Aider is an AI pair programming tool designed for terminal environments, enabling developers to collaborate with AI for code editing and generation.

## Key Features
1. **Terminal-Based AI Pair Programming**
   - Real-time code editing
   - AI-assisted development workflow
   - Git repository integration

2. **Modes of Operation**
   - Code generation
   - Code editing
   - Architectural design
   - Q&A about existing code
   - Multi-language support

3. **Technical Capabilities**
   - Works with local Git repositories
   - Supports multiple programming languages
   - Integrates with various AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
   - Provides context-aware code suggestions

## Comparison Points with Current Implementation
- Verify language detection mechanisms
- Review AI model tier assignments
- Compare delegation and context management strategies
- Evaluate instruction generation patterns

## Research Recommendations
1. Deep dive into Aider's prompt engineering techniques
2. Analyze inter-agent communication methods
3. Study tool usage and function calling patterns
4. Document specific enhancements for our agent system

## Next Steps
- Create detailed feature matrix
- Map Aider's capabilities to our current agent structure
- Identify potential improvements in our agent.yaml configuration

## Observations
The Aider project represents a sophisticated approach to AI-assisted software development, emphasizing:
- Contextual understanding
- Minimal invasive changes
- Flexible AI integration
- Developer productivity

## Potential Enhancements
- Improve context passing between agents
- Refine delegation logic
- Enhance instruction clarity
- Add more granular mode definitions

## Constraints
- Maintain YAML-based configuration
- No external script dependencies
- Preserve existing agent architecture
