# Task: A Simple Sleep tool

Write a `sleep` tool that can be used by LLM to initiate a wait before proceeding to run other tools.
similar to the unix utility:

sleep -- suspend execution for an interval of time

## Requirements 
- [ ] Update /Users/liqiang/workspace/cloudbox/ai/swarm/resource/standard/tools/ai.yaml, add the new sleep tool at the end of the file.
- [ ] Write in golang for the scrip body
- [ ] The tool name is `sleep` (it can be invokded as `ai:sleep`) add description, parameter and other parts accordingly

***important***

Do not work on the change yourself, delegate to `agent:agent/agent` who unstands and specializes in writing/updating agents/tools/models with yaml.

You are tasked with initiating the work, monitoring the progress, and ensuring the delivery of the tool as a project manager.
