Created short READMEs for the four swarm resource states:
- Pilot (Ad hoc Release)
- Incubator (Preview)
- Standard (Stable)
- Core (Foundation)

Files written:
- ./swarm/resource/pilot/README.md
- ./swarm/resource/incubator/README.md
- ./swarm/resource/standard/README.md
- ./swarm/resource/core/README.md

Notes:
- Pilot README emphasizes auto-generated, editable-by-all, single-use lifecycle; promotion triggers to Incubator.
- Incubator README covers preview state and promotion to Standard.
- Standard README describes stability and governance; promotion to Core.
- Core README defines foundational role and governance for core changes.
- A minimal .keep file remains in pilot dir for dir existence visual.
